# scopes-mode
Emacs major mode for the [Scopes](http://scopes.rocks/) programming language.
Highlights all keywords and numbers, along with all symbols defined in
`core.sc` and the default modules.

## Usage
For plugin generation, make sure you have initialized the submodule by cloning with `--recursive` or use `git submodule update --init` in the already cloned folder.
The plugin is partially generated by a scopes program (`generator.sc`). To generate a new
version launch in a shell:

`scopes generator.sc > scopes-symbols.el`

The elisp library itself is already set up to use that file so no further
actions are needed. A pre generated version is already included in the
repository for convenience, so generation is only necessary if it's out of date.
